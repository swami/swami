Swami uses the CMake build system. If you are new to cmake, you should at first compile fluidsynth (you will need it for Swami anyway). Check you their build instructions to get a basic understanding of how CMake works: https://github.com/FluidSynth/fluidsynth/wiki/BuildingWithCMake

Configure build system
-----------------

Change to toplevel Swami source directory and execute:
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..

Some useful options to the configure script ("./configure --help" to list more
options) you probably won't need to specify any of these:

-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=PFX       Prefix where SWAMI is installed (optional)
-DCMAKE_INSTALL_DATADIR=DTDIR    Data dir to use for installing various UI related files (depends on your OS, commonly /usr/share is being used)

Required libraries
-----------------

Swami requires a sound file library to load sample files (WAV, AU etc).

libinstpatch: https://github.com/swami/libinstpatch

GTK+ 2.0 is required. It depends on a number of other libraries as well.
Chances are you already have it.

Compile and install
-----------------

To compile the package execute:
make

To install the binary file "swami" issue a:
make install

Please open a ticket at GitHub if you have problems or suggestions with the build process.
